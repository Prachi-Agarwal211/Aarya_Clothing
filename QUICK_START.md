# 🚀 Aarya Clothing - Quick Start VPS Deployment

## ⚡ Deploy in 3 Commands

```bash
# 1. SSH into your VPS
ssh root@72.61.255.8

# 2. Navigate to project
cd /opt/Aarya_Clothing

# 3. Pull latest changes and deploy
git pull origin testing && chmod +x *.sh && ./fix-and-redeploy.sh
```

That's it! Your site will be live at **https://aaryaclothing.cloud**

## ⚠️ SSL Security Warning

You may see a browser security warning: **"Your connection isn't private"** or **"net::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID"**

**This is NORMAL and SAFE!** Your site uses self-signed SSL certificates for testing.

### To Access Your Site Now:
1. Click **"Advanced"**
2. Click **"Proceed to aaryaclothing.cloud (unsafe)"**
3. Your site will load perfectly

### For Production SSL (No Warnings):
Run this command on your VPS:
```bash
./setup-letsencrypt.sh your-email@example.com
```

This will install trusted Let's Encrypt certificates. See [`SSL_SETUP.md`](SSL_SETUP.md:1) for details.

## 💾 Will Updates Delete My Database?

**NO!** Your database is **safe** during updates. Your data is stored in Docker volumes that persist even when you rebuild containers.

**Safe commands (database preserved):**
- ✅ `git pull` - Updates code only
- ✅ `docker-compose up -d --build` - Rebuilds containers, keeps data
- ✅ `docker-compose restart` - Restarts services, keeps data
- ✅ `./fix-and-redeploy.sh` - Updates everything, keeps data

**Before major updates, backup your database:**
```bash
./backup-database.sh
```

See [`DATA_PERSISTENCE.md`](DATA_PERSISTENCE.md:1) for complete guide.

## 🔧 If Deployment Fails

If you see errors about missing TypeScript or shell variables, run:

```bash
./fix-and-redeploy.sh
```

This script will:
- Fix .env file special characters
- Clean up failed builds
- Rebuild and redeploy all services

## 📋 What's Ready

✅ **Docker Compose** - Configured for production with domain aaryaclothing.cloud
✅ **Nginx Reverse Proxy** - SSL, HTTPS redirect, API routing
✅ **Environment Variables** - Production-ready .env file
✅ **SSL Certificates** - Auto-generated (self-signed for now)
✅ **Deployment Scripts** - Automated setup and health checks

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### SSL Certificate Warning
You'll see a browser security warning because we're using self-signed certificates. This is **normal** for testing. Click "Advanced" → "Proceed to aaryaclothing.cloud" to continue.

### For Production SSL
Replace self-signed certificates with Let's Encrypt:
```bash
apt-get install certbot
certbot certonly --standalone -d aaryaclothing.cloud -d www.aaryaclothing.cloud
cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/aaryaclothing.cloud/fullchain.pem docker/nginx/ssl/aaryaclothing.cloud.crt
cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/aaryaclothing.cloud/privkey.pem docker/nginx/ssl/aaryaclothing.cloud.key
docker-compose restart nginx
```
